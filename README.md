# Full Stack Idea: Macro Tracker App

# Overview
This is a simple application to help users keep track of their daily diet and macros. Users will have the ability to create a daily list of the foods they have consumed,
and add the total protein, carbohydrates, fats, and calories of each meal and then
receive a cumulative score for the day.
The purpose of this application is to enable users to more seamlessly
track their day-to-day diet habits and progress towards improving nutrition.

# Weekly Plan
Monday - Create all data models, get Django backend server and settings setup, organize backend files and directories. Get React boilerplate code into repo.

Tuesday - Set up PostgreSQL database, test on localhost to make sure backend data functionality is up to speed. Continue testing basic backend infrastructure. Connect React to backend via Axios, and then compose basic JSX rendering to test backend connection.

Friday - Continue working on React views. Build out login, signup, and sign out pages first. Build first iteration of basic add and view tracker page, and then build basic add meal and edit meal pages.

Monday - Begin user profile page with React. Upon completion, circle back to Tracker and Meal pages to begin refactoring and adding more engaging design features.

Tuesday/Wednesday/Thursday - Continue refactoring design and test different themes and branding.
